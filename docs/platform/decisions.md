# Platform Decisions

This document serves as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all platform and architectural decisions made in the homelab infrastructure. Each decision is documented with context, rationale, and implications.

## Design Priorities

All infrastructure decisions are guided by the following priorities, in order:

1. **Security** - Secure by default, minimal attack surface
2. **Noise** - Low noise operation for home environment
3. **Efficiency** - Power and resource efficient
4. **Usability** - Simple to operate and maintain

## Decision Summary

| Backup Strategy | ZFS snapshots + offsite replication | Restic-only, Ceph RBD snapshots | Fast local rollback + integrity | Requires ZFS management expertise | Accepted | 2025-12 |
| Deployment Pattern | Single cluster (prod+lab workloads segmented by policy) | Separate clusters, namespaces only | Simplicity, resource consolidation | Blast radius if misconfigured policies | Accepted | 2026-02 |
| Ingress & LB | Cilium Ingress + LB IPAM | NGINX Ingress, Traefik, MetalLB | Integrated stack, fewer moving parts | Feature parity gaps vs mature ingress controllers | Accepted | 2025-12 |
| Database Strategy | Local persistent volumes per service | Central DB cluster, Managed DB (N/A) | Isolation, simple backup surfaces | No shared HA cluster benefits | Accepted | 2026-01 |

## Pending / Future Decisions

| Candidate | Trigger Metric / Condition | Exploration Focus | Target Review |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| HA Control Plane (add etcd) | >1 critical outage / year OR need >1 master | Evaluate k3s multi-server vs kubeadm migration | 2026-Q2 |
| Distributed Storage Layer | Need RWX perf + >2TB DB growth | Evaluate Ceph vs OpenEBS vs Longhorn | 2026-Q3 |
| Trace Collection Expansion | >5 critical services needing tracing | Jaeger vs Tempo vs OTEL-only | 2026-Q2 |
| Multi-site Edge Extension | Edge node requirement appears | Cluster federation vs K3s agents | 2026-Q4 |

## Detailed Decision Records

### Stop Spreading Helm Charts as Default

**Decision Date:** 2024  
**Status:** Active

For simple configurations like cronjobs or basic deployments, the recommended approach is now to create a `kustomization` with FluxCD using plain YAML files instead of Helm charts.

**Rationale:**
- Reduces configuration complexity
- Eliminates layers upon layers of configuration
- Simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance
- Better GitOps workflow integration

**Implementation:**
- Use Helm only for complex applications that benefit from templating
- Prefer Kustomize + plain YAML for simple resources
- Document configuration decisions clearly

### Migration from Loki to Victoria Logs

**Decision Date:** 2025-05-01  
**Status:** Implemented

Replaced Loki with Victoria Logs as the primary log aggregation solution.

**Problem:**
Loki was consuming excessive resources and didn't align with homelab efficiency priorities.

**Analysis:**
- **CPU Usage:** Loki consumed 3x more CPU than Victoria Logs
- **Memory Usage:** Significantly higher memory footprint
- **Operational Complexity:** Victoria Logs offers simpler configuration and maintenance

**Solution:**
- Migrated to Victoria Logs for log aggregation
- Maintained Fluent Bit as log shipper
- Simplified log processing pipeline

**Benefits:**
- 70% reduction in resource consumption
- Simplified operational procedures
- Better integration with Victoria Metrics stack

### Migration from ArgoCD to FluxCD

**Decision Date:** 2024  
**Status:** Implemented

**Problem:**
ArgoCD was consuming entire Raspberry Pi node resources and causing thermal throttling.

**Analysis:**
- ArgoCD resource consumption was excessive for homelab scale
- Thermal constraints in passive cooling setup
- Need for lightweight GitOps solution

**Solution:**
- Migrated to FluxCD for GitOps
- Significantly reduced resource consumption
- Better fit for homelab scale
- Maintained GitOps capabilities

### Raspberry Pi Deprecation

**Decision Date:** 2024  
**Status:** In Progress

**Rationale:**
- Insufficient resources for modern Kubernetes workloads
- Thermal constraints in passive cooling setup
- Better utilization in dedicated projects

**Migration Plan:**
- Remove Raspberry Pi from Kubernetes cluster
- Deploy replacement server with better performance/watt ratio
- Repurpose Pi for dedicated home automation tasks

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Container Runtime: containerd
- **Rationale:** Industry standard, lightweight, secure
- **Alternative Considered:** Docker (deprecated in K8s)

### CNI: Cilium
- **Rationale:** eBPF-based networking, advanced security features, ingress capabilities
- **Alternative Considered:** Flannel (simpler but less features)

### CSI: Local Path Storage + NFS
- **Rationale:** Simple local storage for stateless apps, NFS for shared data
- **Alternative Considered:** Rook-Ceph (too complex for homelab)

### Database: SQLite (K3s embedded)
- **Rationale:** Simple, sufficient for homelab scale, no external dependencies
- **Alternative Considered:** External etcd (unnecessary complexity)

### GitOps: FluxCD
- **Rationale:** Lightweight, GitOps-native, excellent Kubernetes integration
- **Alternative Considered:** ArgoCD (too resource intensive)

### Monitoring: Victoria Metrics
- **Rationale:** Lower resource usage compared to Prometheus, better compression
- **Alternative Considered:** Prometheus (higher resource usage)

### Ingress: Cilium Ingress
- **Rationale:** Integrated with CNI, unified networking stack
- **Alternative Considered:** NGINX Ingress (additional component)

### Service Mesh: None (Future Consideration)
- **Current Rationale:** Additional complexity not justified at current scale
- **Future Trigger:** When service-to-service authentication becomes critical
