# Monitoring & Observability

This document provides an overview of the monitoring and observability strategy implemented in the Kubernetes homelab environment.

## Observability Strategy

The homelab implements a comprehensive observability stack focusing on resource efficiency while maintaining production-grade monitoring capabilities.

### Three Pillars of Observability
```yaml
Metrics:
  Solution: Victoria Metrics
  Purpose: Resource utilization, performance trends
  Retention: 90 days high resolution, 1 year downsampled
  Collection: Prometheus-compatible metrics

Logs:
  Solution: Victoria Logs  
  Purpose: Application and system event tracking
  Retention: 30 days structured logs
  Collection: Fluent Bit and native integrations

Traces:
  Solution: OpenTelemetry (selective implementation)
  Purpose: Distributed request tracing
  Focus: Critical service paths only
  Collection: OTLP protocol compatible
```

## Architecture Overview

### Monitoring Stack Components
```yaml
Data Collection:
  - Victoria Metrics Agent: Metrics scraping
  - Node Exporter: System metrics
  - cAdvisor: Container metrics  
  - Kube State Metrics: Kubernetes object metrics
  - Custom Exporters: Application-specific metrics

Data Storage:
  - Victoria Metrics: Time-series database
  - Victoria Logs: Log aggregation and storage
  - Long-term Storage: Compressed historical data

Visualization:
  - Grafana: Dashboard and alerting interface
  - Custom Dashboards: Homelab-specific views
  - Mobile Access: Responsive dashboard design

Alerting:
  - Victoria Metrics Alert: Rule evaluation
  - Grafana Alerting: Multi-channel notifications
  - Custom Webhooks: Integration with home automation
```

### Resource Efficiency Focus
```yaml
Victoria Metrics vs Prometheus:
  Memory Usage: 70% reduction in RAM consumption
  Storage Efficiency: 50% less disk space required
  Query Performance: 3x faster query response
  Cardinality: Better handling of high-cardinality metrics

Resource Footprint:
  Total Memory: <2GB for complete monitoring stack
  CPU Usage: <0.5 cores average utilization
  Storage: <10GB for 90-day retention
  Network: Minimal overhead with compression
```

## Key Monitoring Areas

### Infrastructure Monitoring
```yaml

  - etcd performance and cluster status
  - API server response times and errors
  - Scheduler and controller manager metrics
```

### Application Monitoring
```yaml

  - Backup completion status and timing
```

## Dashboard Strategy

### Operational Dashboards
```yaml
Cluster Overview:
  - Real-time cluster health status
  - Resource utilization across nodes
  - Active alerts and incidents
  - Capacity planning metrics

Application Health:
  - Service availability status
  - Application performance metrics
  - Error rates and response times
  - Dependency health checks

Infrastructure Status:
  - Hardware health indicators
  - Storage system status
  - Network performance metrics
  - Environmental monitoring (power, temperature)
```

### Capacity Planning
```yaml
Resource Trends:
  - CPU and memory growth patterns
  - Storage utilization forecasting
  - Network bandwidth trending
  - Cost analysis and optimization

Performance Analysis:
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Resource efficiency metrics
  - Workload optimization opportunities
  - Scaling decision support
```

## Alerting Framework

### Alert Categories
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - System outages and failures
  - Data loss or corruption risks
  - Security incidents and breaches
  - Resource exhaustion conditions

Warning Alerts:
  - Performance degradation
  - Capacity approaching limits
  - Configuration drift detection
  - Backup or maintenance failures

Informational:
  - Planned maintenance notifications
  - Capacity planning recommendations
  - Performance optimization suggestions
  - Security audit findings
```

### Notification Channels
```yaml
Immediate (Critical):
  - Mobile push notifications
  - SMS for infrastructure failures
  - Email for detailed incident reports
  - Slack/Discord for team coordination

Batched (Warning/Info):
  - Daily summary emails
  - Weekly capacity reports
  - Monthly performance reviews
  - Quarterly optimization recommendations
```

## Observability Best Practices

### Metrics Collection
```yaml
Collection Strategy:
  - Right-sized scrape intervals (15s-5m based on metric type)
  - Selective metric collection to reduce cardinality
  - Proper labeling strategy for efficient queries
  - Retention policies aligned with use cases

Performance Optimization:
  - Recording rules for frequently queried metrics
  - Downsampling for long-term storage efficiency
  - Efficient label usage to minimize series explosion
  - Query optimization and caching strategies
```

### Log Management
```yaml
Log Collection:
  - Structured logging with consistent formats
  - Appropriate log levels for different environments
  - Centralized collection with minimal overhead
  - Retention policies based on compliance needs

Log Analysis:
  - Pattern recognition for common issues
  - Correlation between logs and metrics
  - Efficient search and filtering capabilities
  - Automated log analysis and anomaly detection
```

## Troubleshooting and Incident Response

### Diagnostic Workflows
```yaml
Incident Detection:
  - Automated alert triggering
  - Anomaly detection algorithms
  - Correlation rule evaluation
  - Manual monitoring and reporting

Investigation Process:
  - Centralized dashboard access
  - Historical data correlation
  - Root cause analysis tools
  - Documentation and knowledge base

Resolution Tracking:
  - Incident timeline reconstruction
  - Impact assessment and metrics
  - Post-incident review process
  - Improvement action items
```

### Runbook Integration
```yaml
Automated Responses:
  - Self-healing for common issues
  - Automatic scaling based on load
