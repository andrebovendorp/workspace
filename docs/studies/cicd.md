# CI/CD Pipeline Study

Study focused on implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.

## Overview

This study explores modern CI/CD practices and their implementation in a Kubernetes environment.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand CI/CD principles
- Implement automated testing
- Setup deployment pipelines
- Configure GitOps workflows
- Monitor pipeline performance

## Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline includes:
- Source code management
- Automated testing
- Container image building
- Security scanning
- Deployment automation
- Monitoring and alerting

## Tools and Technologies

- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD platform
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Kubernetes** - Orchestration
- **Flux** - GitOps controller
- **Helm** - Package management

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Source** - Code commit triggers pipeline
2. **Build** - Application compilation and testing
3. **Package** - Container image creation
4. **Deploy** - Automated deployment to environments
5. **Monitor** - Health checks and metrics

## Implementation
